# Task Management API

## Introduction
This Task Management API is built using the Go programming language with the Gin framework and SQLite database. It provides a simple yet powerful way to manage tasks with functionalities like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Requirements
- Go 1.15+
- Gin Web Framework
- SQLite3

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://yourrepository.git
cd yourproject
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Usage
Start the server:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## API Endpoints
- POST /tasks: Create a new task.
- GET /tasks: List all tasks.
- GET /tasks/{id}: Retrieve a task by ID.
- PUT /tasks/{id}: Update a task by ID.
- DELETE /tasks/{id}: Delete a task by ID.

## Examples
Create a task:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -d '{"title":"New Task","description":"Description","dueDate":"2024-01-01"}'
```
List tasks:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

Here are example curl commands for testing each functionality of your Task Management API:

Create a New Task
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "New Task", "description": "Task description", "dueDate": "2024-03-01"}'
Retrieve a Task by ID
Replace {id} with the actual ID of the task.

bash
Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}
Update a Task
Replace {id} with the ID of the task you want to update.

bash
Copy code
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Updated Title", "description": "Updated description", "dueDate": "2024-03-10"}'
Delete a Task
Replace {id} with the ID of the task you want to delete.

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}
List All Tasks
bash
Copy code
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks
Ensure you replace {id} with the actual ID of the task you're targeting in the retrieve, update, and delete commands.

```
