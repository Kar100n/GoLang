Creating a concise README.md for your Task Management API developed with Go and the Gin framework:

```markdown
# Task Management API

## Introduction
This Task Management API is built using the Go programming language with the Gin framework and SQLite database. It provides a simple yet powerful way to manage tasks with functionalities like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Requirements
- Go 1.15+
- Gin Web Framework
- SQLite3

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kar100n/GoLang.git
cd yourproject
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

## Usage
Start the server:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## API Endpoints
- POST /tasks: Create a new task.
- GET /tasks: List all tasks.
- GET /tasks/{id}: Retrieve a task by ID.
- PUT /tasks/{id}: Update a task by ID.
- DELETE /tasks/{id}: Delete a task by ID.

## Examples
Create a task:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -d '{"title":"New Task","description":"Description","dueDate":"2024-01-01"}'
```
List tasks:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

Here's how to format the instructions into a README.md format for your Task Management API:

```markdown
# Task Management API Usage Examples

## Create a New Task
To create a new task, use the following `curl` command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "New Task", "description": "Task description", "dueDate": "2024-03-01"}'
```

## Retrieve a Task by ID
To retrieve a task by its ID, replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the task:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}
```

## Update a Task
To update an existing task, replace `{id}` with the ID of the task you want to update:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "Updated Title", "description": "Updated description", "dueDate": "2024-03-10"}'
```

## Delete a Task
To delete a task, replace `{id}` with the ID of the task you want to delete:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}
```

## List All Tasks
To list all tasks:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks
```

Remember to replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the task for the retrieve, update, and delete commands.
```

This format provides clear instructions for interacting with your API, organized by task action for easy reference.
